#Final Project README

Goal: This code is allow the user to analyze this very big weight and height data set I found online.
Reference: https://gist.github.com/nstokoe/7d4717e96c21b8ad04ec91f361b000cb#file-weight-height-csv  

NOTES: I DO NOT OWN THIS DATA SET. This data set I found online and was from GitHub Gist. It was created by nstokoe.

When you first run the program,it will display the first 5 rows and last 5 rows of the data set.
The program will display the row number, gender, height, weight, the height category, and weight category.
The user can see all these categories.
The code takes the height and weight and categories it.
For the height, 0-58 is considered short, 58-65 is normal, and anything taller than 65 is tall.
For the weight, 0-110 is considered light, 110-170 is considered normal, and anything heavier than 170 is heavy. 
The code will categorize the data.

The code will also display a subset and a subset of tall males. 
This subset will display the first 5 tall males and the last 5 tall males. 
It tells the user how many tall males there are through the subset dimensions.

Next, the code tells the user the average height and average weight of both males and females.

Last the code asks the user if they want to search for a specific row number. 
If the user wants to, they will enter in row number.
If the user doesn't want to, they can type "quit" to exit the program. 
The user can quit the program whenever they please.

If the user inputs a row number, the code finds the row nunber and displays the result to the user.
The user will have access to the row number, gender, height, weight, what height category the person fell under, and what weight category the person fell under.
The results will also be taken and added to a CSV file.
The user can input the row number again or type quit to exit the program.

Note to Grader:

The advanced topics I decided to use are Advanced Strings, Git, and NumPy and Pandas
This code does not use 7.1 or 7.5 as I could not find an apporiate place to use these features.
I hope I can still get credit for the Advanced strings as I did include 7.2, 7.3, and 7.4 in my code.
The code should use all the criteria of NumPy and Pandas. 

Thank you for your work this semester and have a great winter break!
